# Vote38: Revolutionizing Voting and Polling with Blockchain

## Introduction

Vote38 is a decentralized opinion poll and voting platform leveraging the Stellar Network. It provides a secure, transparent, and user-friendly interface for creating and participating in public polls. The platform integrates Flutter for mobile app development and Firebase for real-time data streaming, ensuring a seamless and interactive user experience. This document explores the use cases, benefits, and technical architecture of Vote38, with a focus on how it can enhance existing tasks and solve specific challenges, particularly in Nigeria.

## How It Works

### Poll Creation

1. **Poll Creation**: Users can create polls in the Vote38 app, detailing the poll description and candidate information. This is done through an intuitive interface that guides the user through each step.
   
2. **Election Post**: A Stellar account, known as the Election Post, is created to store poll data and NFT metadata. This account serves as the central hub for the poll.

3. **NFT Minting**: An NFT token is minted for the election and transferred to the Election Post account. This NFT represents a unique voting token that will be distributed to voters.

4. **Candidate Accounts**: The Election Post sponsors candidate accounts, each containing candidate details and establishing a trustline to the NFT. These accounts are essential for tracking votes received by each candidate.

### Voting Process

1. **User Authentication**: Users log into the Vote38 app, with sessions securely stored using Flutter secure storage. This ensures that user data is protected and that each user can only vote once per poll.

2. **Request to Vote**: Users request to vote and receive an NFT token from the polling account. This token represents their ability to cast a vote.

3. **Casting a Vote**: Users transfer the NFT token to their chosen candidate's account, updating the candidate’s vote balance. This process is secure and transparent, with each vote being recorded on the blockchain.

4. **Viewing Results**: Firebase streams real-time election data, allowing users to see up-to-date results for each candidate. This ensures transparency and immediate feedback on the poll's progress.

## Technical Architecture

### Components

- **Vote38 App**: Built with Flutter, providing an interface for creating polls, voting, and viewing results.
- **Stellar Network**: Manages accounts, NFTs, trustlines, and token transfers.
- **Firebase**: Streams election data and updates users' timelines with new election posts.
- **Flutter Secure Storage**: Ensures secure storage of user sessions.

### Data Flow

1. **Poll Creation**:
    - User initiates poll creation in the app.
    - The app creates an Election Post account on Stellar and mints an NFT token.
    - The NFT token is transferred to the Election Post account.
    - The Election Post sponsors candidate accounts and sets up trustlines.

2. **Voting**:
    - User logs into the app and requests to vote.
    - The polling account transfers an NFT token to the user.
    - The user transfers the token to a candidate’s account, updating the candidate’s balance.
    - Firebase streams the updated candidate balances for real-time result viewing.

### Avoiding Multiple Voting

To ensure each user can only vote once per poll, the following mechanisms are implemented:

1. **Authorization Required Flag**: 
    - The NFT asset is issued with the `AUTH_REQUIRED_FLAG` enabled. This requires accounts to get explicit approval from the issuer before holding the asset.

2. **Record of Approved Accounts**: 
    - Maintain a database of accounts that have been approved to hold the NFT asset.

3. **Selective Trustline Approval**: 
    - When an account requests to hold the asset by creating a trustline, check if the account is in the approved list. If approved, authorize the trustline using the `SET_TRUST_LINE_FLAGS` operation with the `AUTHORIZED_FLAG`. If not, reject the trustline.

### Implementation Example

Here's an example of how to approve a trustline in Dart:

```dart
import 'package:stellar_flutter_sdk/stellar_flutter_sdk.dart';

Future<void> approveTrustline(
    String issuerAccountId, 
    String issuerSecret, 
    String accountToApprove, 
    Asset issuedAsset) async {

  final server = Server("https://horizon.stellar.org");
  final KeyPair issuerKeypair = KeyPair.fromSecretSeed(issuerSecret);

  // Load issuer account
  final issuerAccount = await server.accounts.account(issuerAccountId);

  // Create the transaction builder
  final transactionBuilder = TransactionBuilder(issuerAccount)
    ..addOperation(SetTrustLineFlagsOperationBuilder(
      accountToApprove, 
      issuedAsset, 
      setFlags: TrustLineFlags.AUTHORIZED_FLAG)
    )
    ..setTimeout(30);

  // Build the transaction
  final transaction = transactionBuilder.build();

  // Sign the transaction
  transaction.sign(issuerKeypair);

  // Submit the transaction
  await server.submitTransaction(transaction);
}
```

### Usage:

```dart
void main() async {
  const String issuerAccountId = 'G...'; // Issuer Account ID
  const String issuerSecret = 'S...'; // Issuer Secret Seed
  const String accountToApprove = 'G...'; // Account to approve
  final Asset issuedAsset = AssetTypeCreditAlphaNum4('TOKEN', issuerAccountId); // Issued Asset

  await approveTrustline(issuerAccountId, issuerSecret, accountToApprove, issuedAsset);
}
```
